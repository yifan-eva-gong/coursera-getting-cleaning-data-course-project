# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## About
This repository contains my work for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project, including R scripts to clean the raw data, a codebook explaining the procedure, and the final output - a tidy dataset.

## Data Source
Following coursera's instructions, raw data can be found here https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. It represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, with about 600 variables and 10,000 observations in total. A more detailed description can be found here http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

## Codebook
The Codebook.md file explains the data transformation procedures, including features selected, new variables created, etc.

## Data Output
The tidy_data.txt contains a tidy dataset created after running the run_analysis.R file. Interpretations of the dataset can be found in the Codebook.
