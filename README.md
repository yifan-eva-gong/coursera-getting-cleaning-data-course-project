# coursera-getting-cleaning-data-course-project

## About
This repository contains my work for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project, including R scripts to clean the raw data, a codebook explaining the procedure, and the final output - a tidy dataset.

## Data Source
Following coursera's instructions, raw data can be found here https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. It represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, with about 600 variables and 10,000 observations in total.
